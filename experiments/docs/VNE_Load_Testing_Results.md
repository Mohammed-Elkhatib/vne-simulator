## Key Research Findings

### Load Scaling Behavior

**Light Load (15 VNRs):**
- All algorithms perform reasonably well (67-73% acceptance)
- Yu2008 shows best acceptance ratio (73%)
- RW_BFS achieves best cost efficiency (0.900 revenue/cost)
- Network has sufficient capacity for moderate embedding

**Medium Load (25 VNRs):**
- Significant performance drop across all algorithms (36-40% acceptance)
- Simple_Greedy and RW_MaxMatch maintain best acceptance (40%)
- RW_BFS shows excellent cost efficiency despite lower acceptance (0.950)
- Critical transition point where resource constraints become severe

**Heavy Load (35 VNRs):**
- All algorithms reach resource saturation (~31-37% acceptance)
- Yu2008 maintains slight advantage (37% vs 31%)
- Performance differences become minimal under extreme load
- Network capacity fundamentally limits all approaches

### Algorithm Characteristics Under Load

**Yu2008 (Revenue-Based Chunked):**
- Maintains best acceptance ratios at light (73%) and heavy (37%) loads
- Benefits from batch optimization during resource scarcity
- Consistently higher revenue generation per accepted VNR
- Shows resilience to increasing load pressure

**Simple_Greedy (Baseline):**
- Surprisingly competitive at medium load (40% acceptance)
- Stable cost efficiency across load levels (0.860-0.886)
- Degrades gracefully without dramatic performance cliffs
- Provides reliable baseline performance

**RW_BFS (Random Walk with BFS):**
- Excellent cost efficiency across all loads (0.900-0.950)
- Lower acceptance at medium/heavy loads but superior resource utilization
- Most efficient algorithm in terms of cost per successful embedding
- Best choice when cost minimization is priority

**RW_MaxMatch (Random Walk with Max Matching):**
- Competitive at light (67%) and medium (40%) loads
- Significant cost efficiency drop at heavy load (0.799)
- Performance degrades more severely under extreme resource pressure
- Good middle-ground algorithm for moderate loads

## Technical Validation

### Experimental Framework Performance
- All load testing scenarios completed successfully
- Comprehensive visualization generation for all algorithms
- Peak resource utilization snapshots show realistic constraint behavior
- Timeline visualizations demonstrate proper temporal dynamics

### Load Testing Methodology
- German 7-node substrate (realistic topology for controlled testing)
- Systematic VNR load scaling: 15 → 25 → 35 requests
- Identical VNR characteristics across experiments for fair comparison
- Fixed substrate capacity to observe pure load scaling effects

## Implications for Algorithm Selection

### Load-Dependent Algorithm Choice

**Light Load Environments (≤15 VNRs):**
- Yu2008 recommended for maximum acceptance ratio
- RW_BFS recommended for cost-sensitive applications
- All algorithms perform adequately

**Medium Load Environments (20-25 VNRs):**
- Simple_Greedy or RW_MaxMatch for best acceptance rates
- RW_BFS for cost optimization scenarios
- Critical load range requiring careful algorithm selection

**Heavy Load Environments (≥30 VNRs):**
- Yu2008 provides marginal advantage in extreme conditions
- Algorithm choice less critical due to resource saturation
- Focus should shift to capacity planning rather than algorithm optimization

### Performance Degradation Patterns
- **Linear degradation**: 67% → 40% → 31% acceptance as load increases
- **Critical threshold**: Major performance drop between 15-25 VNRs
- **Saturation point**: Minimal algorithm differences beyond 30 VNRs
- **Cost efficiency**: Inversely related to load pressure across algorithms

## Resource Utilization Insights

### Network Capacity Analysis
- German 7-node topology reaches saturation around 30-35 VNRs
- Resource constraints become binding factor beyond algorithm sophistication
- Peak utilization snapshots show realistic >90% resource usage during heavy load
- Timeline patterns reveal rapid resource exhaustion under heavy demand

### Algorithm-Specific Resource Patterns
- **Yu2008**: Higher absolute resource consumption but better acceptance
- **RW_BFS**: Most efficient resource utilization per successful embedding
- **Simple_Greedy**: Predictable resource usage patterns
- **RW_MaxMatch**: Variable efficiency depending on load conditions

This load testing framework provides essential insights for capacity planning and algorithm selection under varying demand scenarios, establishing clear performance baselines for different operational conditions.
