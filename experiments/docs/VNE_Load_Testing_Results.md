## Key Research Findings

### Load Scaling Behavior

**Light Load (15 VNRs, low demands):**
- Perfect performance across all algorithms (100% acceptance)
- RW_BFS achieves best cost efficiency (0.978 revenue/cost ratio)
- All algorithms handle light load without resource constraints
- Network capacity more than adequate for light VNR demands

**Medium Load (25 VNRs, medium demands):**
- Performance drop but still reasonable (64-84% acceptance)
- RW_BFS and RW_MaxMatch tie for best acceptance (84%)
- Simple_Greedy drops to 64%, Yu2008 to 76%
- Critical transition point where algorithm differences emerge

**Heavy Load (35 VNRs, high demands):**
- Severe resource pressure (26-51% acceptance)  
- RW_MaxMatch achieves best acceptance (51%), RW_BFS close second (49%)
- Simple_Greedy and Yu2008 show poor heavy load performance (26%, 29%)
- Algorithm sophistication becomes crucial under heavy load

### Algorithm Characteristics Under Load

**RW_BFS (Random Walk with BFS):**
- **Strong overall performer**: 100% → 84% → 49% acceptance across loads
- Excellent cost efficiency consistently (0.920-0.978 revenue/cost ratio)
- Superior resource utilization and embedding optimization
- Best choice for cost-sensitive scenarios

**RW_MaxMatch (Random Walk with Max Matching):**
- **Best heavy load performer**: 100% → 84% → 51% acceptance across loads
- Good cost efficiency (0.830-0.924) with excellent heavy load resilience
- Outperforms RW_BFS specifically under extreme resource pressure
- Recommended for high-load scenarios

**Yu2008 (Revenue-Based Chunked) - ⚠️ Critical Finding:**
- **Revenue-greedy cascade failures discovered under load**
- Performance: 100% → 76% → 29% acceptance (worst heavy load degradation)
- **Root cause**: Processes VNRs in revenue-descending order within chunks
- **Problem**: High-revenue VNRs consume premium resources, lower-revenue VNRs fail
- **Result**: "Rich get richer" bias - failed VNRs average 113.7 revenue vs successful 151.8
- Timeline visualization accuracy confirmed - early failures are real algorithm behavior

**Simple_Greedy (Baseline):**
- Predictable performance: 100% → 64% → 26% acceptance
- Stable cost efficiency across load levels (0.827-0.847)
- Degrades gracefully but lacks optimization sophistication
- Reliable baseline for performance comparison

## Technical Validation

### Experimental Framework Performance
- All load testing scenarios completed successfully using VNE literature methodology
- Comprehensive visualization generation for all algorithms and load levels
- Peak resource utilization snapshots show realistic constraint behavior
- Timeline visualizations accurately represent real algorithm behavior (Yu2008 analysis confirmed)

### Load Testing Methodology (VNE Literature Standard)
- German 7-node substrate network (7 nodes, 11 edges, 790 total CPU, 1145 total bandwidth)
- **Dual scaling approach**: VNR count (15→25→35) AND resource demands increase
- **Resource demand scaling**: CPU (10-20)→(15-30)→(20-40), BW (5-15)→(10-25)→(15-35)
- Diverse VNR topologies: path, star, cycle, tree, random (sizes 2-6 nodes)
- Fixed substrate capacity to isolate algorithm performance under load stress

## Implications for Algorithm Selection

### Clear Algorithm Ranking Established

**Primary Recommendation: RW_MaxMatch**
- **Best heavy load performance**: Maintains 51% acceptance under extreme pressure
- **Consistent strong performance**: 100% → 84% → 51% across load scenarios
- **Good cost efficiency**: 0.830-0.924 revenue/cost ratio
- **Recommended for**: High-load operational environments

**Secondary Choice: RW_BFS**
- **Best cost efficiency**: Excellent 0.920-0.978 revenue/cost ratios
- **Strong light/medium performance**: 100% → 84% → 49% acceptance
- **Slightly lower heavy load tolerance**: 49% vs RW_MaxMatch's 51%
- **Recommended for**: Cost-sensitive or light/medium load environments

**Caution Required: Yu2008**
- **Major algorithmic flaw identified**: Revenue-greedy cascade failures
- **Poor load scaling**: Worst degradation under increasing load (100%→29%)
- **Resource allocation bias**: Unfair to lower-revenue VNRs
- **Use only if**: Specifically optimizing for high-revenue VNR acceptance

**Baseline Reference: Simple_Greedy**
- **Predictable performance**: Stable but unoptimized behavior
- **Acceptable baseline**: Useful for comparison and basic implementations
- **Limited optimization**: Cannot compete with sophisticated algorithms

### Performance Degradation Patterns  
- **RW_MaxMatch best scaling**: 100% → 84% → 51% (excellent heavy load resilience)
- **RW_BFS excellent efficiency**: 100% → 84% → 49% (superior cost ratios)
- **Yu2008 worst degradation**: 100% → 76% → 29% (poor heavy load scaling)
- **Simple_Greedy predictable decline**: 100% → 64% → 26% (baseline degradation)
- **Critical load threshold**: Performance differentiation emerges around 20-25 VNRs

## Resource Utilization Insights

### Network Capacity Analysis Under Load
- German 7-node substrate (790 CPU, 1145 BW) handles ~13-14 light VNRs efficiently
- Resource constraints emerge at ~20-22 medium-demand VNRs
- Heavy load scenarios stress substrate to ~60% maximum capacity utilization
- Timeline patterns show realistic resource competition and exhaustion progression

### Algorithm-Specific Resource Efficiency
- **RW_BFS**: Most efficient resource utilization - achieves highest acceptance with optimal cost ratios
- **RW_MaxMatch**: Good resource efficiency, competitive with RW_BFS in most scenarios  
- **Simple_Greedy**: Predictable but suboptimal resource usage patterns
- **Yu2008**: Inefficient due to revenue-bias - wastes resources on failed high-revenue attempts

### Yu2008 Resource Allocation Flaw Analysis
**Critical Discovery**: Yu2008's revenue-greedy processing creates resource allocation inefficiency:
- **Revenue bias**: Prioritizes high-revenue VNRs (190-195) over lower-revenue ones (88-131)
- **Resource waste**: Failed high-revenue attempts consume substrate capacity unnecessarily
- **Cascade effect**: Lower-revenue VNRs in same chunk left with insufficient resources
- **Timeline accuracy confirmed**: Early failures visible in timeline plots are real algorithm behavior

1. **Clear algorithm ranking established**: RW_MaxMatch > RW_BFS > Simple_Greedy > Yu2008
