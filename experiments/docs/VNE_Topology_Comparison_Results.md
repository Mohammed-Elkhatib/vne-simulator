## Key Research Findings

### Network Difficulty Classification

**Challenging Networks (60-85% acceptance):**
- ER_8_dense: Most difficult due to high node density with limited connectivity
- Grid_9: Structured topology with sparse connectivity creates bottlenecks
- ER_8_sparse: Low connectivity limits embedding options

**Moderate Networks (80-90% acceptance):**
- BA_8: Scale-free properties provide some embedding advantages

**Easy Networks (90-100% acceptance):**
- German: Real-world network with well-balanced topology
- Italian: Larger size with good connectivity distribution

### Algorithm Performance Patterns

**RW_BFS (Random Walk with BFS):**
- Consistently best or tied for best performance across all topologies
- Achieves 100% acceptance on real networks (German, Italian)
- Maintains strong performance even on challenging random networks
- Most robust algorithm across different network characteristics

- Competitive performance on challenging topologies (85% on dense networks)
- Benefits from batch optimization approach
- Strong candidate for comparison with RL algorithms

**RW_MaxMatch (Random Walk with Max Matching):**
- Solid performance across all network types
- Particularly effective on structured networks (Grid, BA)
- Achieves 100% on Italian network
- Consistent 85-90% performance on challenging networks

**Simple_Greedy (Baseline):**
- Clear performance degradation on challenging topologies
